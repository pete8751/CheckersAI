# CheckersAI

This project is a checkers simulator that allows users to choose between various automated Checkers algorithms, and to watch how their chosen strategy performs against others. The algorithms currently implemented include the MinMax algorithm (with and without pruning), The "Aggressive" Algorithm (optimizes for pieces captured), and the random algorithm. The final Algorithm is the tree based AI algorithm. All of these algorithms apart from Random were implemented using trees. The AI algorithm starts with an empty tree, but extends its tree the more games it plays, learning which moves end badly, and which are more favorable. I am currently working on creating an exe version of this project.
